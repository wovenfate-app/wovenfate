# Wovenfate — Week 1 scaffold

React + Vite rebuild of the branching-story engine, multi-voice narration,
and hands-free voice choices, ported from the single-file HTML prototype.

## Windows setup notes

Everything here is cross-platform (Node/Vite/Supabase don't care about
OS) — only two commands need a Windows-specific version:

- **Install Node.js first** if you haven't: nodejs.org → LTS version →
  installer. This gives you `node` and `npm` in Command Prompt/PowerShell.
- **Unzipping**: right-click the zip → "Extract All" in File Explorer,
  or in PowerShell: `Expand-Archive wovenfate-app.zip`. (The `unzip`
  command from the earlier instructions is a Linux/Mac thing.)
- **Everything else** (`npm install`, `npm run dev`, `node supabase/seed.js`,
  `git` commands) — run exactly as written, in PowerShell, Command Prompt,
  or Git Bash (installed alongside Git for Windows) — all three work.
- **Git for Windows**: if you don't have `git` yet, get it from
  git-scm.com — installs Git Bash too, which behaves like a Linux
  terminal if you'd rather use that throughout.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

## What's here

- `src/engine/useStoryEngine.js` — branching logic (choices, flags,
  branchOn) as a framework-agnostic hook. This never changes when you add
  a new title.
- `src/engine/useNarration.js` — multi-voice narration: loads available
  browser voices, splits chapter text into narrator/her/his segments, and
  queues them for playback.
- `src/engine/useVoiceChoice.js` — hands-free voice recognition for
  choosing options. **Chrome only** (Android/desktop) — Safari doesn't
  implement the Web Speech recognition API at all. This gets fixed for
  real in Week 7 when we wrap for native and swap in iOS's Speech
  framework / Android's SpeechRecognizer.
- `src/data/stories/ember-court.js` — the flagship title's content, in
  the `{ startNode, nodes }` shape the engine expects. Any future title
  (hardcoded, or fetched from Supabase) just needs to match this shape —
  that's the whole mechanism for multi-title support later.
- `src/components/` — presentation only; no story logic lives here.

## Known gaps (expected at this stage — Week 1 is engine migration only)

- No Supabase connection yet (Week 1 also stands up the schema, next).
- No paywall/purchase logic yet (Week 3).
- Dialogue speaker-detection is still heuristic (context-based guessing),
  same limitation as the prototype — worth revisiting once content moves
  to structured storage, where speaker can be tagged per line instead of
  guessed.
- No automated tests yet — flagged for the Week 8 testing pass, but
  honestly worth adding incrementally as each engine piece stabilizes
  rather than saving it all for one big push at the end.

## Next (Week 1, remaining)

- Supabase project + schema (titles, nodes, users, purchase_state)
- Deploy this skeleton to Vercel

### Supabase setup

1. Create a project at supabase.com (free tier).
2. Project → SQL Editor → paste and run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Project Settings → API → copy the Project URL and `anon` public key.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` /
   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Also grab the `service_role` key (same page)
   for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — needed only for the seed script below,
   never used in the app itself.
5. Seed The Ember Court into the database:
   ```bash
   node supabase/seed.js
   ```
6. The app still imports `ember-court.js` directly for now (Week 1 is
   about proving the schema works, not rewiring `App.jsx` yet) — swapping
   `App.jsx` to call `fetchTitle('ember-court')` instead of the static
   import is a small, deliberate next step once you've confirmed the seed
   worked (check the Supabase Table Editor — `titles` should have 1 row,
   `nodes` should have 14).

### Live data, accounts, and resume progress (this session)

`App.jsx` now fetches from Supabase instead of a hardcoded file, and every
reader gets a silent anonymous account so their progress can be saved and
resumed — no login screen, no signup friction, just reading.

**One required dashboard step:** anonymous sign-in is off by default.
- Supabase dashboard → **Authentication** → **Sign In / Providers**
- Find **Anonymous Sign-Ins** → toggle it **on**

Without this, `useAuth` will fail silently on `signInAnonymously()` and
nothing will save.

**To verify it's working:**
1. `npm run dev`, open the app, click through a couple of choices
2. Supabase dashboard → **Table Editor** → `auth.users` — you should see
   a new row (anonymous, no email) appear
3. **Table Editor** → `reading_progress` — should show a row with your
   `current_node_id` updating as you click through (there's an ~800ms
   save delay by design, so it won't update instantly on every click)
4. Refresh the browser tab entirely — you should land back where you
   left off, not at Chapter One

**Known gap, not yet built:** there's no way for a reader to turn their
anonymous session into a real account (email/password or magic link) —
which matters once purchases exist, since an anonymous session can be
lost (cleared cookies, new device) and take a paid unlock with it. This
is real Week 2/3 scope, not an oversight — flagging it so it doesn't get
forgotten once the paywall goes in.

### Paywall setup (Stripe + Edge Functions)

Free through the end of Chapter 3 (the binding scene) — everything from
Chapter 4 onward, plus all four endings, is locked until purchase. The
gate is enforced server-side: the client only ever *reads* the
`purchases` table, it never writes to it — the Stripe webhook is the
only thing allowed to record a purchase, so there's no way to spoof an
unlock from the browser.

**One UX note vs. the earlier mockup:** the paywall now appears as its
own full screen right after a Chapter 3 choice, rather than overlaid
with blurred choice buttons on the Chapter 3 screen itself — simpler
and more robust to build correctly. Worth revisiting later if the
blurred-preview version tests better once you have real readers.

**1. Run the migration** (your DB already exists from Week 1, so this is
an addition, not the full schema again):
- Supabase → SQL Editor → paste and run `supabase/migrations/002_paywall.sql`

**2. Re-run the seed** so the `locked` flags reach the database:
```
node supabase/seed.js
```

**3. Create a Stripe account** at stripe.com if you don't have one.
Stay in **Test mode** (toggle, top right of the Stripe dashboard) until
you're ready to take real payments — test mode uses fake card numbers,
zero real money moves.

**4. Get your Stripe secret key**
- Stripe dashboard → **Developers** → **API keys**
- Copy the **Secret key** (starts `sk_test_...` in test mode)

**5. Install the Supabase CLI** (needed to deploy Edge Functions —
different from the `supabase-js` npm package already in this project):
- Windows: `scoop install supabase` (install Scoop first from scoop.sh if you don't have it)
- Mac: `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`

**6. Link the CLI to your project**
```
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
```
(Project ref is the part before `.supabase.co` in your project URL.)

**7. Set the function secrets** (these stay server-side, never in `.env.local`):
```
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
supabase secrets set SITE_URL=https://wovenfate.vercel.app
```
(`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` comes in step 9, after Stripe gives it to you.)

**8. Deploy both functions**
```
supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```
This prints each function's URL — you'll need the `stripe-webhook` one next.

**9. Create the Stripe webhook**
- Stripe dashboard → **Developers** → **Webhooks** → **Add endpoint**
- Endpoint URL: the `stripe-webhook` URL from step 8
- Select event: **checkout.session.completed**
- Save, then copy the **Signing secret** shown (starts `whsec_...`)
```
supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**10. Test it end-to-end**
- Run the app, click through to Chapter 4 — paywall should appear
- Click **Unlock this book** → redirects to Stripe Checkout
- Use Stripe's test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC
- Should redirect back and unlock within a few seconds (polling covers
  the brief gap while the webhook processes)
- Supabase Table Editor → `purchases` → should show a new row

### Landing page + account upgrade (this session)

**Landing page:** the app no longer drops straight into Chapter 1. There's
now a front screen (Wovenfate brand, featured title, tagline) with a
"Start Reading" / "Continue Reading" button (the label itself tells you
whether saved progress was found). It loads fast because it only queries
the lightweight `titles` row — the full story text only fetches once you
actually enter the reader.

**Account upgrade:** anonymous readers now see a quiet "Save your
account" link inside the reader (not the landing page — didn't want it
competing with the main CTA before anyone's even started). This lets a
reader attach an email to their existing anonymous session — Supabase
keeps the same user id, so purchases and progress carry over
automatically, no data migration involved.

**One required Supabase setting** for the confirmation email's link to
actually redirect back to your app instead of erroring:
- Supabase dashboard → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
- **Site URL:** `https://wovenfate.vercel.app`
- **Redirect URLs:** add both `https://wovenfate.vercel.app/**` and
  `http://localhost:5173/**` (or whichever port your dev server uses) so
  the flow works in both production and local testing

**To verify account upgrade works:**
1. In the reader, click "Save your account" → enter a real email you can check → Save
2. Check that inbox for a confirmation email from Supabase
3. Click the link — should redirect back to the app
4. Supabase → Authentication → Users → that user's row should now show
   the real email instead of blank/anonymous
5. Reload the app in the *same* browser — should still resume correctly
   (proves the user id, and everything keyed to it, didn't change)

### Multi-title catalog (this session)

The app no longer hardcodes a single title — `App.jsx` reads a real
catalog from Supabase, the landing page lists every published title,
and each has independent progress, paywall state, and purchase status.

**The Binding Oath** is the second title, following the exact same
proven structure as Ember Court: free through Chapter 3, locked from
Chapter 4, 4 endings gated by the same guarded/trust flag mechanic.
Nothing about the engine, paywall, or narration needed to change for
this — that's the payoff of building it generically the first time.

**To add any future title**, the only two things needed:
1. A new `src/data/stories/<title-id>.js` file matching the
   `{ startNode, nodes }` shape (copy `binding-oath.js` as a template)
2. Register it in the `titles` array at the top of `supabase/seed.js`

Then `node supabase/seed.js` — it appears in the catalog automatically.

**Re-run the seed to add Binding Oath to your existing database:**
```
node supabase/seed.js
```
Should print two lines now — one per title.

**One thing to redeploy** — the checkout function now passes the title
through the Stripe redirect (needed now that there's more than one
title to return to):
```
supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
```

**To verify:**
1. `npm run dev` — landing page should show *two* title cards
2. Start The Binding Oath, click through to Chapter 4, confirm the
   paywall appears
3. Unlock it with the Stripe test card — confirm it redirects back to
   *this* title specifically, unlocked, not Ember Court
4. Go back to the landing page — both titles should independently show
   "Continue Reading" if you have progress on each

### Narration UX polish (this session)

Three related fixes:

- **Voice picker is filtered to English-only, alphabetised.** A raw
  system voice list is often 40+ entries covering every installed
  language — genuinely unusable as a picker. Nothing here is
  non-English content, so nothing else was relevant anyway.
- **Narrator settings are collapsed by default.** The three voice
  pickers and toggles no longer sit permanently at the top of every
  chapter — there's a compact play button + one-line summary
  ("auto-read on · hands-free on") with a "Narration settings" link
  that expands the full panel when actually needed.
- **Settings persist across sessions**, via `localStorage`, keyed by
  voice *name* rather than index — a saved index would point at a
  different voice next session since the exact list composition and
  order isn't guaranteed stable across browser restarts. Auto-read,
  hands-free, and all three voice choices now survive a reload or
  returning later, instead of resetting to defaults every time.

**Known limitation, unchanged:** this is still per-device/per-browser
(same reasoning as before — voices themselves are device-specific, so
this isn't stored in Supabase). A reader switching devices gets fresh
defaults there, which is expected, not a bug.

### App-shell polish (this session)

The single biggest thing that made this feel like a webpage rather than
an app: everything scrolled as one flat document, with the title/brand
just sitting inline at the top like a page heading. Fixed:

- **Fixed header bar** (`AppHeader`) — persists at the top with a blur
  backdrop while content scrolls underneath, back button on the reader,
  current chapter name as a subtitle. This one change does more for the
  "app" feeling than anything else here.
- **Page-turn transition** — each chapter fades/slides in on
  navigation, instead of content just snapping into place.
- **Tap feedback** — buttons scale down slightly on press (`:active`),
  which reads as tactile/native rather than a static webpage click.
- **Safe-area insets** (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`) — header and content
  padding account for notches/home indicators once installed as a PWA
  on a real device, not just visually correct in a browser tab.
- **Contained overscroll** — no rubber-band bounce revealing background
  past the edges of content, which is a small thing that reads as
  "browser tab" the moment it happens.

### Bug fix + content review pass (this session)

**Pause/resume bug, fixed:** clicking "Pause" set the browser's speech
engine to paused, but the app never tracked that as distinct from
"speaking" — so the button just kept calling `pause()` again instead of
ever calling `resume()`. `useNarration` now has a real `isPaused` state,
and the button correctly cycles through Read aloud → Pause → Resume.

**Content review — both titles read through in full for continuity and
punctuation.** Found and fixed:
- Ember Court: a tagged question ("What does that mean," you ask, "in
  practice.") was missing its question mark — fixed to "in practice?"
- Ember Court: "ember court" appeared lowercase twice in the prose
  despite being the story's proper-noun title — capitalized to "Ember
  Court" for consistency in both places
- Binding Oath: same missing-question-mark issue ("did you just do.")
  — fixed to "did you just do?"
- Binding Oath: a genuine grammar error — "the binding holds them a way
  in" isn't valid English — corrected to "the binding leaves them a way
  in"

No structural issues found — all choice `next`/`branchOn` references
resolve to real nodes, all locked flags are correctly placed on both
titles' Chapter 4+ content, and both titles' diamond branch structures
are intact.

### Narration resumes mid-chapter, not just mid-book (this session)

Previously, "Continue Reading" correctly took you back to the right
*chapter*, but narration always restarted that chapter's audio from the
very beginning — there was no memory of how far into it you'd actually
listened.

Fixed: `useNarration`'s `speakNode` now accepts a `startIndex` and an
`onSegmentStart` callback. As each line of dialogue/narration plays, its
position is saved to `localStorage` (per-device, same reasoning as
voice choice — playback position is tied to this device's specific
narration, not meaningful to sync elsewhere). The *first* time narration
plays in a session, it checks for a saved position on the current
chapter and resumes there; any *subsequent* chapter change in that same
session always starts fresh, since that's a new chapter, not a
returning one. Position clears automatically once a chapter finishes
narrating naturally, so revisiting it later starts from the top again
rather than the end.

**To verify:** start reading with auto-read on, let a chapter play for
a few lines, then close the tab entirely (not just navigate away).
Reopen, hit Continue Reading — narration should pick up from roughly
where you left off, not the first line again.

**Follow-up fix — resume was landing one paragraph too far ahead.** The
actual cause: `synth.cancel()` (called by `stop()`, or by starting a new
chapter's narration) fires `onerror` on whatever utterance was
mid-speech — and that error handler was treating *any* error, including
an intentional cancellation, as "this segment finished, advance."  So
every stop was silently advancing the saved position past what had
actually been heard. Fixed by checking `event.error` — only a genuine
synthesis failure advances the queue now; a cancellation just stops.

### Three new titles + landing page redesign (this session)

**Catalog is now five titles**, all following the same proven diamond
structure (free through Chapter 3, locked from Chapter 4, 4 endings
gated by the guarded/trust flag):

- **Court of Salt and Drowning** — a healer bargains with an exiled
  sea-fae prince to save her sister from the tide's claim
- **The Last Warden's Heir** — she inherits a centuries-old bond to the
  demon her bloodline was founded to guard against
- **Ashbound** — an arranged marriage is the only thing standing
  between two warring dragon-shifter houses and open war reigniting

Each has its own cover art (generated the same way as the first two,
same brand palette, distinct motif per story — ripple rings for the sea
court, a warden's sigil for the last title, facing dragon-wings for
Ashbound).

**Landing page redesign** — replaced the stacked list of full-width
cards with a proper app-catalog layout:
- **Hero banner** at the top (the flagship title's cover art as a
  full-bleed background with a headline overlay) instead of a small
  static icon
- **Horizontal-scroll catalog rows** (the standard mobile-app pattern —
  App Store, Spotify, Netflix all use this) instead of a long vertical
  scroll of cards
- **A separate "Continue Reading" row** appears above "All Stories"
  whenever the reader has progress on anything, so returning readers
  see their in-progress titles first without hunting for them

**Re-run the seed** to get all five titles into the database:
```
node supabase/seed.js
```
Should print five lines now.

**Redeploy the checkout function is NOT needed this time** — no changes
to that piece. Just seed, then `npm run dev` and confirm the landing
page shows the new hero + scrollable rows with all five covers.

### Shareable endings (this session)

Every ending now has a "Share your ending" button that generates a
vertical (story-format, 1080×1920) branded image — cover art, the
title name, and the ending name as the headline — entirely client-side
via Canvas, no server/image-generation cost involved.

**Sharing behavior:**
- Where the Web Share API supports sharing files (most mobile
  browsers, notably iOS Safari), it opens the native share sheet —
  same "share to Instagram/Messages/etc." flow as any other app
- Everywhere else (most desktop browsers), it falls back to a plain
  image download

**One thing worth doing before relying on this for real marketing
reach:** the footer currently says "wovenfate.app" as a placeholder
— worth replacing with your actual production domain once you have
one, since that's the whole point of a shareable image driving new
readers back to the app.

**To verify:** finish any story to an ending, click "Share your
ending," confirm the image generates correctly (check cover art shows,
text is legible, no layout overlap) either via the share sheet or the
downloaded file.

### Restart bug fix — applies to all 5 books (this session)

**Bug:** clicking "Read again" from an ending would briefly reset to
Chapter 1, then immediately snap back to whatever chapter had been
saved from *before* that reading session (e.g. Chapter 4).

**Root cause:** a safety-net effect in `useStoryEngine` exists to catch
a narrow timing case — saved progress arriving from Supabase *after*
the component's first render. Its guard was "resume hasn't happened yet,
AND the choice-path is currently empty." But `restart()` also empties
the choice-path — that's how it resets to Chapter 1 — so calling
restart looked identical to that timing edge case and incorrectly
re-triggered a resume from the old saved position.

Fixed two ways: `hasResumed` now correctly initializes to `true`
whenever there was real saved progress at mount (previously it
incorrectly stayed `false` through ordinary reading, only becoming
`true` via that narrow effect path), and a separate `hasRestartedRef`
permanently blocks the resume safety-net from firing again after any
explicit restart, regardless of state timing.

This lives in the shared engine every title runs on, so it's fixed for
all five books at once — nothing book-specific needed.

**To verify:** get any title to Chapter 4+ so there's real saved
progress, reach an ending, click "Read again, choose differently" —
should land on Chapter 1 and stay there.

### Rebrand: Emberbound → Fatewoven → Wovenfate (this session)

**The journey:** Emberbound collided with an actively published,
similarly-themed interactive fiction game (itch.io/Steam, 4.9★).
Fatewoven checked clean across 18+ search rounds and trademark mirrors
— but a direct domain check (the thing that actually caught it, after
search missed it entirely) turned up a small, live, identically-named
RPG already running at fatewoven.app. Wovenfate — the same words,
reversed — passed every check: search, trademark mirrors, and a direct
fetch of the domain itself.

**Domain confirmed owned:** wovenfate.app and wovenfate.co.uk are
registered. wovenfate.com is held by someone else, but appears to be
an unconfigured/parked registration (no HTTPS support at all — the
signature of a domain nobody's actively running a product on), not a
real competing product. `.app` is the better technical fit for a PWA
anyway.

**What changed in code** (already done, this pass): every remaining
"Fatewoven" reference — app title, PWA manifest, `package.json`,
landing page header, ending-share image wordmark/footer, localStorage
keys, and the Stripe function's site-URL comment. The app icon (woven
threads mark) needed no change — it represents the concept, not the
word order, so it fits "Wovenfate" exactly as it fit "Fatewoven."

**What still needs action from you, outside this codebase:**

1. **Rename the Vercel project** — Settings → project name → this
   changes the `*.vercel.app` URL itself.
2. **Connect wovenfate.app as the custom domain** on Vercel once
   you're ready to go live on it, rather than relying on the
   `*.vercel.app` URL long-term.
3. **Update the SITE_URL secret** to match whichever URL is live:
   ```
   supabase secrets set SITE_URL=https://your-live-url-here
   ```
   No redeploy needed — takes effect immediately.
4. **Rename the GitHub repo** (optional but recommended).
5. **Rename your local project folders** — see the "One-time folder
   rename" section at the top of `QUICK-COMMANDS.md` for exact steps.

**To verify the code side:** `npm run dev`, confirm the browser tab
and landing page both say "Wovenfate," and generate a share image on
any ending to confirm it says "Wovenfate" / "wovenfate.app."

### Account entry point moved to the header (this session)

Previously, saving an account required already being inside a specific
book — a small link buried in the reader, invisible until a reader had
already started something. Moved to a persistent icon in the fixed
header instead, visible on every screen including the landing page.

- **Anonymous readers** see a small dot on the account icon (a subtle
  "you haven't done this yet" indicator) — tapping it opens the same
  save-your-account form as before, just reachable from anywhere
- **Linked accounts** see no dot, and tapping shows a simple "Signed in
  as [email]" confirmation instead
- Still entirely optional and non-blocking — reading still starts with
  zero friction, this just makes the option discoverable from the
  first screen instead of hidden mid-story

`AccountUpgrade.jsx` (the old inline link) is removed; `AccountModal.jsx`
replaces it, reusing the same `useAccountUpgrade` hook underneath — no
change to the actual linking mechanism, just where it's surfaced.

**To verify:** the account icon (person silhouette) should now show in
the header on the landing page itself, not just once you're reading.

### Real sign-in + purchase account gate (this session)

**The gap this closes:** "save your account" (built earlier) only
protected progress on the *same* device — there was no way to actually
sign into that account from a different device. That's fixed now, and
purchases are protected by requiring a real account before checkout
rather than relying on a reader remembering to save one afterward.

**One unified email flow, three outcomes** (`useEmailAuth.js`):
1. New email, currently a guest → links this email to the current
   anonymous session (same mechanism as before) — progress/purchase in
   progress on this device is preserved.
2. Email already belongs to an existing account (reader's on a new
   device) → falls back to a real sign-in link for that account
   automatically. One form handles both cases — no separate
   "Sign Up" vs "Sign In" UI needed, matching how passwordless auth
   naturally works.
3. **No passwords anywhere** — deliberately. This eliminates password
   resets as a concern entirely, not just defers it.

**Purchase gate:** clicking "Unlock this book" while still anonymous
now shows the same email-auth form *instead of* the checkout button —
reading through Chapter 3 remains completely free and frictionless as
a guest, but a real account is required at the exact moment money
would change hands, so a purchase can never end up tied to a session
that gets silently lost.

**Landing page:** a light, dismissible "Have an account? Sign in — or
just start reading below as a guest" prompt appears for anonymous
visitors. Non-blocking — the catalog and all free content are
available immediately regardless of whether it's used.

**Redirect handling:** the magic-link email brings the reader back to
the *exact* screen they were on — the specific book/chapter they were
trying to unlock, not just the homepage — via `emailRedirectTo`, the
same pattern already used for the Stripe checkout redirect.

**Worth testing carefully, this one has a real async round-trip:**
1. As a guest, read any title to Chapter 4 — paywall appears
2. Instead of a Buy button, the email-auth form should show
3. Enter an email you can check → submit
4. Check that inbox for a link → click it
5. Should land back on **that exact locked chapter**, now signed in
6. The paywall should now show the actual "Unlock this book" button
7. Complete a test purchase — confirm it's tied to the signed-in
   account (Supabase → Authentication → Users → real email, not blank)

**Also worth testing:** the "already have an account" fallback —
try step 3 above with an email that's *already* linked to a different
account from earlier testing, and confirm it correctly says "we sent
a sign-in link" rather than erroring.

### Bundle pricing (this session)

Full-library bundle: £10.00 for all 5 books (vs. £14.95 bought
individually). Shown two places:
- **Landing page** — full promo card below the catalog, "★ Best Value"
  badge, both prices shown with the savings called out
- **Paywall** — a compact one-line upsell under the single-book unlock
  button ("Or unlock all 5 books for £10.00 — save £4.95")

**How it's implemented — no schema changes needed:** a bundle purchase
writes the exact same `purchases` row shape as a single purchase, just
one row per published title instead of one. `usePurchase`'s existing
per-title unlock check needed zero changes to recognize a
bundle-purchased title as unlocked — it's just reading the same table.

- Bundle price (£10.00) lives **server-side only**, in the edge
  function — same "never trust a price from the client" rule as single
  titles
- Same account-required gate as single purchases — a guest clicking
  the bundle CTA sees the same email-auth form first
- The webhook branches on `metadata.type` (`'bundle'` vs `'single'`) —
  bundle fetches every published title and upserts a row per title in
  one batch

**One coordination fix worth knowing about:** `usePurchase`'s
checkout-success polling effect used to clear the URL's success params
unconditionally — which would have silently eaten a bundle purchase's
`?bundle=true` redirect before `useBundlePurchase` got a chance to read
it, since `usePurchase` is always mounted (even with no title selected,
on the landing page). Fixed by gating that effect on an actual titleId
being present.

**Both edge functions changed and need redeploying:**
```
supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

**To verify:**
1. Landing page shows the bundle card below the catalog with correct
   pricing (£10.00, £14.95 struck through, save £4.95)
2. As a guest, click it → auth gate appears (same as single-book flow)
3. Sign in, click again → Stripe Checkout, test card `4242...`
4. After redirect: **every** title should show unlocked, not just one
   — check by visiting Chapter 4 on 2-3 different titles
5. Supabase → `purchases` table → should show 5 new rows (one per
   title), all sharing the same `receipt` (the Stripe session id)
6. Revisit the landing page → bundle promo should now say "You own the
   full library" instead of showing the upsell again

### Three fixes from real-world testing (this session)

**1. Bundle purchase wasn't unlocking anything, despite Stripe showing
success.** Real root cause, not a code bug this time: the *deployed*
webhook function was still running the old pre-bundle code (my earlier
CLI-deploy instructions weren't followed through, or didn't fully
apply — either way, confirmed and fixed directly by redeploying via the
connected Supabase tool this time). The old webhook saw
`type: 'bundle'` metadata with no `title_id`, treated that as an
error, and silently returned without writing anything — Stripe
genuinely charged (test mode), nothing ever got unlocked. Verify the
correct version is live any time you're unsure:
Supabase dashboard → Edge Functions → stripe-webhook → check it
references `type === 'bundle'` in the code.

**2. Confusing extra click after email verification.** Previously,
verifying your email brought you back to the *same* paywall screen,
requiring a second click on "Unlock" to actually start checkout.
Fixed: the redirect now carries an `autoPurchase` marker (`single` or
`bundle`), and once the reader is confirmed signed in, checkout starts
automatically — no second click needed. Applies to both single-title
and bundle purchases, from both the landing page and the paywall.

**3. Bundle option looked like a subtle text link, not a real choice.**
The compact paywall upsell is now a proper secondary button (ember
outline, matching the primary unlock button's shape) rather than
small underlined text — meant to actually draw the eye as a real
option, not a footnote.

**To verify all three:** as a fresh guest, hit any paywall, click the
new bundle button (should look like a real button now), go through
email verification, and confirm checkout starts automatically on
return (no extra click) — then confirm every title shows unlocked
afterward, not just the one you were reading.

### "Purchased" status on catalog cards (this session)

Catalog cards now show **Purchased** in place of the price once a
title's actually been bought — takes priority over "In progress,"
which takes priority over the default "Free start · £X.XX." Mirrors
the exact same `fetchInProgressTitleIds` pattern already used for
reading progress, just for the `purchases` table instead.

Refreshes on: returning to the landing page (same refresh point as
reading progress), and separately when a bundle purchase completes —
since a bundle can redirect straight to the landing page with no
specific title to navigate "back" from, that path needed its own
refresh trigger tied to `bundle.hasFullLibrary` confirming.

**To verify:** purchase any single title, return to landing — that
card should say "Purchased." Purchase the bundle — all 5 should
update, including if the bundle redirect lands you straight on the
landing page rather than back at a specific book.

### Fair bundle pricing — "complete your collection" credit (this session)

**Real bug, found through testing:** buying books individually then the
bundle afterward could cost *more in total* than the bundle itself —
e.g. 2 individual books (£5.98) + full bundle (£10) = £15.98, more than
buying all 5 as singles from scratch (£14.95). The bundle was charging
full price regardless of what was already owned.

**Fixed server-side** (`create-checkout-session`, deployed directly
through the connected Supabase tool) — the bundle checkout now:
1. Looks up what the reader already owns
2. Credits what they already paid against the bundle price
3. Charges `max(£0.30, £10.00 − already paid)` — Stripe's real
   documented GBP minimum is the floor, since a charge can't go to £0
4. If they already own everything, checkout is refused outright with a
   clear error rather than double-charging for nothing

**Guarantee this gives:** total spend across *any* purchase order —
one book then the bundle, three books then the bundle, whatever —
never exceeds what the bundle costs outright. Buying in a different
order is never penalized.

**Client-side display updated to match** — `BundlePromo` now mirrors
the same formula (same constants, same math) so what's shown before
checkout is always the real price, not a flat £10.00 regardless of
ownership. When there's credit, the copy adapts too: "Complete your
collection — 3 left," a note showing the credited amount, and the CTA
says "Unlock the remaining 3 books" instead of "all 5."

**Already deployed** — no `supabase functions deploy` needed this time,
done directly through the connector while building this.

**To verify:** buy 1–2 titles individually, then check the bundle
promo — price should be less than £10.00 and the copy should mention
your credit. Complete that purchase and confirm in Stripe's dashboard
(test mode) that the actual charge matches the discounted amount shown,
not a flat £10.00.

### Legal pages: Terms, Privacy, Refund Policy (this session)

Three documents drafted, reflecting how the app actually works (not
generic boilerplate) — bundle pricing, passwordless auth, Stripe/
Supabase/Vercel as named processors, the fade-to-black content's 18+
framing, and a no-refund-once-unlocked stance with the UK Consumer
Contracts Regulations exception it relies on spelled out plainly.

**Source markdown lives in `legal-drafts/`** (not shipped publicly —
reference/editing copies). **Live pages are in `public/`**:
`terms.html`, `privacy.html`, `refunds.html` — styled to match the
app's actual brand rather than a plain text dump, linked from a new
footer on the landing page.

**Before these go live for real, not just test mode, four things need
filling in** (search each file for bracketed placeholders):
1. `[BUSINESS NAME]` — your actual trading name/entity, in all three
2. `[DATE]` — the date you actually publish these
3. Company registration details in Terms §1, if/once incorporated
4. Confirm `support@wovenfate.app` is a real, monitored inbox before
   launch — right now it's a placeholder until the custom SMTP/domain
   email setup happens

**Also flagged, deliberately, at the top of each document:** these are
AI-assisted drafts, not reviewed by a solicitor. They're built to
actually reflect the product accurately rather than being generic
filler — but real legal review is worth doing before you're processing
real payments at volume, not after.

**To verify:** `npm run dev`, scroll to the bottom of the landing page,
confirm the three footer links work and the pages render correctly
styled (dark theme, matching fonts) rather than plain unstyled text.

### Native wrapper groundwork (this session)

**Honest split of labor on this one:** actually scaffolding the native
iOS/Android projects needs real network access (fetching Capacitor's
platform templates from npm) and, for iOS specifically, an actual Mac
or cloud Mac build service — neither of which this sandbox has. So
this session prepared everything that *can* be done without that,
to make the remaining steps as close to one-command as possible.

**Done here:**
- `capacitor.config.ts` — app ID (`com.wovenfate.app` —
  **confirm this before your first real build**, it can't be changed
  after App Store submission without becoming a new app), app name,
  matches the web build output folder, background color set to avoid
  a white flash on launch
- Capacitor dependencies added to `package.json`
- `resources/icon.png` (1024×1024, fully opaque — required for App
  Store) and `resources/splash.png` (2732×2732), both on-brand,
  ready for `@capacitor/assets` to auto-generate every required
  iOS/Android size from
- `codemagic.yaml` — a starter CI config for free-tier cloud iOS
  builds. **This genuinely could not be tested in this sandbox** —
  treat it as a solid template to refine once you've connected the
  repo to Codemagic, not a guaranteed first-try success. The parts
  needing your actual Apple Developer credentials are clearly marked
  and can't be filled in here since they're private to your account.

**What you'll actually run, in order, once this update is applied:**

```
npm install
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npx capacitor-assets generate
npx cap sync
```

Then:
1. Push to GitHub (as usual)
2. Sign up at codemagic.io, connect this repo
3. Codemagic UI → Teams → Environment variables → create the
   `app_store_credentials` group referenced in `codemagic.yaml`, add
   your App Store Connect API credentials there
4. Trigger a build — expect to iterate on `codemagic.yaml` a bit on
   the first attempt, since CI configs commonly need small adjustments
   once they meet a real project for the first time

**Android** can be built entirely locally via Android Studio (free,
runs fine on Windows) — no cloud service needed for that half.

### The Ember Court — full rewrite to a richer prose style (this session)

All 14 nodes rewritten/expanded to match a new, more elaborate style:
denser sensory detail, more internal physicality, new worldbuilding
(the borderlands cabin setting, formal hunter's oath/training, the
court reframed as a subterranean dark-water realm rather than
ambiguous fae territory). Chapters 1–3 use the exact text provided;
the remaining 11 nodes (the alternate paths, both Act 4/5 branches,
and all 4 endings) were expanded to match that same density — 400–600
words per chapter throughout, up from the original's roughly 250–350.
Total length grew from ~4,000–5,000 words to just over 6,100.

**Structure, locking, and branching are completely unchanged** —
same 14 node IDs, same 9 locked behind the paywall, same choice
targets and flag logic. Verified before shipping: brace-balanced,
every single choice reference resolves to a real node, locked-node
count matches the original exactly. This is a content rewrite, not a
structural one.

**Re-seed required** since story text changed:
```
node supabase/seed.js
```

**To verify:** read through fresh — confirm the new borderlands/hunter
framing feels consistent start to finish, and that all 4 endings are
still reachable via their original paths (guarded+hold → Severance,
open-guard+hold → Reckoning, open heart → Surrender, walk away →
Unbound).

### Reader App pattern for native builds (this session)

**Why:** outside the US, Apple requires digital content purchased inside
an app to go through Apple's own In-App Purchase system (15–30% cut)
unless the app has no in-app purchase flow at all — the "Reader App"
exemption Kindle, Netflix, and Spotify's traditional apps use. Building
full native IAP (StoreKit + Google Play Billing, with separate
server-side receipt validation for each) would have been a significant
additional project. This avoids that entirely.

**What changed:** on native builds only (`Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`
— see `src/engine/platform.js`), the paywall and bundle promo show
price information but **no tappable purchase button or link at all** —
just plain text pointing to wovenfate.app. This is the most
conservative interpretation, deliberately avoiding even the
"external link" gray area (which has its own entitlement requirements
outside the US and has seen inconsistent enforcement). The web/PWA
version is completely unaffected — full Stripe checkout flow, exactly
as before.

**How a reader actually buys on native:** they read the informational
text, open wovenfate.app in their own browser, sign into the same
account, purchase there. Next time they view that title in the native
app, it shows unlocked automatically — no special handling needed,
since ownership is tied to the account, not the device or app.

**Files touched:** `Paywall.jsx`, `BundlePromo.jsx` (both variants),
new `src/engine/platform.js`. No changes to `App.jsx`, no new
dependencies — `@capacitor/core` was already in `package.json` from
the earlier native-wrapper groundwork.

**To verify:** this can only be properly tested once the native build
actually exists (`npx cap add ios/android`, still your step to run
locally) — in a regular browser, `isNativeApp()` always returns false,
so the web/PWA purchase flow should look completely unchanged. Once
you have a native build running, confirm the paywall shows price +
informational text with no button, while the web version still works
exactly as before.

### Cross-device auto-refresh while waiting on email confirmation (this session)

**The bug:** if the magic link was checked on a *different* device than
the one waiting (e.g., started on PC, clicked the email on phone), the
PC tab stayed stuck showing "check your inbox" indefinitely — the
purchase/account linking succeeded correctly, but the original tab had
no way to know, since there's no live connection between two unrelated
browser sessions.

**The fix, and why it actually works for the cross-device case
specifically:** `AuthGate` now polls `supabase.auth.refreshSession()`
every ~4.5 seconds while waiting (giving up quietly after ~3 minutes).
A plain local session check wouldn't have caught this — the original
tab's *own* session genuinely hasn't changed. But `refreshSession()`
asks Supabase for the account's *current server-side state*, which
does reflect the other device's confirmation, since both devices
share the same underlying account. That refresh fires the same
auth-state-changed event `useAuth.js` already listens to everywhere
else, so `isAnonymous` flips to `false` automatically — no new
plumbing needed in `Paywall.jsx` or `BundlePromo.jsx`, since both
already react correctly to that prop changing.

**To verify (the real cross-device test):** start on one device, send
the email, click the link on a *different* device, then just wait on
the original screen without touching it — it should update to show
the normal unlock button (or auto-proceed to checkout, if it was
reached via a same-device redirect) within about 5 seconds, with no
manual refresh.

### Cross-device auto-refresh, corrected (this session)

**The previous fix (relying on `supabase.auth.refreshSession()` to pick
up updated auth claims) didn't actually work in testing** — and there
turn out to be real, documented inconsistencies in exactly this part
of Supabase's behavior (anonymous-to-linked account transitions don't
reliably update session claims the way the docs imply). Rather than
guess at a second auth-claims-based fix, this switches to a mechanism
already proven to work elsewhere in the app: polling the `purchases`
table directly by `user_id`, the same thing `usePurchase` already does
after a same-device Stripe redirect.

**Why this version is actually reliable, not just a second guess:** a
reader's account `user_id` never changes when it gets linked from
anonymous to a real account — only the `is_anonymous` flag does. The
paywall's locked/unlocked state (`isLockedAndUnpaid` in `App.jsx`)
already depends only on `purchase.isUnlocked`, never on `isAnonymous`
— so this fix doesn't need the auth session to refresh *at all*. It
just needs to notice the purchase row exists, which a plain database
query can do regardless of what the stale tab's JWT still claims.

**What changed:** `usePurchase` and `useBundlePurchase` both gained a
`waitingForLink` parameter — when true, they poll the purchases table
every ~4.5 seconds (giving up after ~3 minutes) independent of any URL
parameter. That "waiting" state, previously local to `Paywall`/
`BundlePromo`, is now lifted up to `App.jsx` (where the hooks
themselves live) and passed down as `waiting`/`setWaiting` props, so
the hook can actually see it.

**`AuthGate`'s earlier refreshSession() polling was left in place**
(harmless, and still potentially useful for the non-purchase "save your
account" case, which has no purchases table to check against) — this
is a second, more reliable safety net specifically for purchases, not
a replacement.

**To verify (the real cross-device test):** start a purchase on one
device, complete email confirmation *and* checkout entirely on a
different device, then just wait on the original screen — it should
flip from paywall to unlocked content within about 5 seconds, with no
manual refresh.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this project to a GitHub repo.
2. vercel.com → New Project → import the repo → it auto-detects Vite.
3. Add the two `VITE_SUPABASE_*` environment variables in the Vercel
   project settings (Settings → Environment Variables) — same values as
   your `.env.local`.
4. Deploy. You'll get a real HTTPS URL — this replaces the Netlify Drop
   link from the prototype phase with something stable and shareable.
